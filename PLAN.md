# Plan
1. Record MVP scope: grid-based movement, scoring, food, powerups, wrap power.
2. Build bash MVP (snake.sh) that handles tick loop, input, render, powerups, game over art.
3. Add Play.bat to launch bash via Git for Windows.
4. Add automated tests for movement boundary handling, food generation, powerup activation, scoring, wrap behavior.
5. Document game features, controls, scoring, powerups, and testing instructions in FEATURES.md.
